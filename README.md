# Hi there! ðŸ˜ƒ

From an early age, I have been passionate about technology, which led me to graduate in Information Systems at UniFOA (Volta Redonda, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) in 2021. Even before completing my degree, I was already working in the field.

I started my career in 2021 at TecnoSpeed's innovation lab, where I specialized in Vue.js and TypeScript. Later, I joined several teams within the company, being responsible for designing and maintaining new modern and responsive interfaces for its main products. I worked with technologies such as Vue.js, Nuxt, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and co-created and served as the lead maintainer of the companyâ€™s design system.

My main focus is developing interfaces that combine design, functionality, and best practices in UI and UX, delivering high-quality solutions with a strong emphasis on user experience.
